## 📄 Projects (pinned & resume-connected)

### 🌍 **Motor Unit Tracking from High-Density EMG + Ultrasound**
**Problem:** Non-invasive tracking of individual motor units across sessions is critical for diagnosing neuromuscular disorders.

**What I did:** Developed a transformer-based pipeline to decompose HD-sEMG signals and align with ultrafast ultrasound muscle motion.

**How I solved it:** Engineered modular preprocessing, transformer-based modeling, and robust session alignment.

**Outcome:** Demonstrated biopsy-free motor monitoring; contributed to NIH R21 project & co-authored a scoping review.

### 🔎 **Autism Classification from fMRI using Graph Attention Networks**
**Problem:** Limited clinical models integrate white matter signals for ASD diagnosis.

**What I did:** Designed a Graph Attention Network (GAT) integrating gray and white matter connectivity.

**How I solved it:** Built full-stack fMRI pipelines using PyTorch, SPM12, and GNNExplainer.

**Outcome:** Achieved 80.4% accuracy (GM+WM); proposed pediatric transfer learning roadmap.

### 🎥 **fMRI Decoding from CNN Visual Features during Naturalistic Stimuli**
**Problem:** Understanding brain responses to naturalistic stimuli remains challenging.

**What I did:** Extracted hierarchical CNN features from video frames and aligned them with fMRI BOLD signals.

**How I solved it:** Built VGG16-based pipeline; applied GLM and reverse mapping for interpretability.

**Outcome:** Published in *Psychoradiology*; revealed correspondence between CNN layer depth and brain hierarchy.
