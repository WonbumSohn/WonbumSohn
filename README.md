## 📄 Projects (pinned & resume-connected)

### 💪 **Motor Unit Tracking from High-Density EMG **

### 🧠 [**Autism Classification from fMRI using Graph Attention Networks**](https://github.com/WonbumSohn/fMRI_ASD)
**Problem:** Limited clinical models integrate white matter signals for ASD diagnosis.

**What I did:** Designed a Graph Attention Network (GAT) integrating gray and white matter connectivity.

**How I solved it:** Built full-stack fMRI pipelines using PyTorch, SPM12, and GNNExplainer.

**Outcome:** Achieved 80.4% accuracy (GM+WM); proposed pediatric transfer learning roadmap.

### 🧠 [**fMRI Decoding from CNN Visual Features during Naturalistic Stimuli**](https://github.com/WonbumSohn/fMRI_MW)
**Problem:** Understanding brain responses to naturalistic stimuli remains challenging.

**What I did:** Extracted hierarchical CNN features from video frames and aligned them with fMRI BOLD signals.

**How I solved it:** Built VGG16-based pipeline; applied GLM and reverse mapping for interpretability.

**Outcome:** Published in *Psychoradiology*; revealed correspondence between CNN layer depth and brain hierarchy.

### 🖥️ **Facial EMG-based VR Avatar Control**
**Problem:** Camera-based facial tracking in VR raises privacy and occlusion concerns.

**What I did:** Developed EMG classifier for 11 emotions using CNNs.

**How I solved it:** Built real-time interface integrating signal processing and avatar logic.

**Outcome:** Enabled privacy-preserving emotion-based control in VR settings.

### 🧬 [**AI-enhanced Raman Spectroscopy for Early Detection of Skin Cancer**](https://github.com/WonbumSohn/RS_UV)
**Problem:** Early UV-induced skin damage is hard to detect non-invasively.

**What I did:** Designed a SLMK-CNN model for Raman spectral classification.

**How I solved it:** Modeled raw and processed spectra; highlighted molecular biomarkers.

**Outcome:** Achieved >96% accuracy; published in *Journal of Raman Spectroscopy*.
